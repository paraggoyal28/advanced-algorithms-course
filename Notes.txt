Cuts 
Given a network G, a cut C, is a set of vertices of G such that C contains all the sources of G and no sinks of G.
The size of the cut is given by
|C| = sum of all e out of C (Ce)

Let G be a network. For any flow F and any cut C,
|f| <= |C|


For any cut C
MaxFlow <= |C|

MaxFlow-MinCut
For any network G,
max flow |f| = min cuts |C|

There is always a cut small enough to give the correct upper bound.

Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
Idea:
Start with zero flow
Repeatedly add flow
Stop when cannot add

If capacities all are integers, then all flows produced are integers.

If a network G has integral capacities, there is a maximum flow with integral flow rates.

Total Runtime: O(|E||f|) |f| is the size of maximum flow.

Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is quite slow if |f| is large.
